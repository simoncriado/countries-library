# Countries Library

Personal project to practice the usage of data from an external API. Key project functionalities:

  - See each countryÂ´s flag and some information about it
  - Possibility to search by country name
  - Possibility to filter by continent
  - Name search and continent filter work combined. This means that, for example, if you are filtering Asia and you try to search Germany, no results will be shown
